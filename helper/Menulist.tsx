And we have listed them below.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After consulting with the experts at our <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.b3net.com/dallas-seo-internet-marketing-service.html\">Dallas SEO company</a></strong>, we have curated a comprehensive arsenal of digital strategies to highlight the solutions one can look for to fix each underlying issue.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, without further delay, let&#8217;s just dive in straight to answer your main concern, “<strong>Why is my website traffic going down?</strong> Why is my website not generating enough leads? And, most importantly, how do I fix it?”</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 1: Improper SEO Use</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO is a crucial factor in lead generation. Unfortunately, it is the most undervalued digital marketing strategy used. When it comes to organic lead generation, nothing beats SEO.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7783\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"842\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When your website does not feature in the search results, it means you are non-existent in the eyes of your visitors. Wondering why your website traffic is going down? The answer lies in several factors, one of which has to do with SEO.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When your website lacks a robust SEO integration, it will struggle to rank on the Search Engine&#8217;s Result Pages (SERPs). It ultimately results in low visibility and decreased organic traffic which otherwise could have generated a chunk of leads for your website.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it? <strong>Intelligent SEO Use</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.b3net.com/essential-steps-to-conduct-an-effective-seo-competitive-analysis\"><strong>SEO</strong></a> is an ongoing process. Thus, launching and letting a well-optimized website on its own will soon make it redundant in the sea of internet traffic. It&#8217;s like letting your website die a slow death and you don’t want that. So, below are a few key things you can do to revive your website and start ranking well on the search engines.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Get a thorough SEO audit done for your website</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Identify the underlying SEO issues with your website and recognize the pages that are already well-optimized vis-a-vis the ones that are not. Not all pages rank equally, nor do all pages require equal SEO integration. Smart SEO use is the key here.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Conduct keyword research and identify the relevant keywords and phrases related to your industry and target audience.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Incorporate the keywords naturally into your website’s content, headers, meta tags, URLs, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Optimize the images and other components of your website.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Build high-quality backlinks.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Monitor, analyze, and reconcile SEO activities through data-driven insights regularly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No doubt, SEO requires specialized knowledge, expertise, and experience. It is hard work as well, however, once done correctly, it reaps the dividends rich and thick. To revive your website, save it from drowning, and make it a lead-generation magnet, consider availing the services of a professional <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.b3net.com/\">digital marketing company</a></strong> like <strong>B3NET Inc.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 2: Lagging Page Speed</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7786\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The message is loud and clear, visitors dislike slow-loading websites and are uncompromising in this matter. If your website takes too long to load, it will hamper your SEO activities, ranking factor, and the flow of organic traffic as well, resulting in missed opportunities to tap into the potential leads for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it? <strong>Improve Page Speed</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Page load speed is a non-negotiable factor to generate traffic and quality leads to your website. The answer lies in “Improving” your website’s loading time, and you can take the following steps to ensure your website loads at lightning-fast speed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Begin by assessing your website’s current load time by using tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Minimize, compress, or combine coding scripts in your website.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Optimize your website’s images and video files.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Enable smart cache management in the browser to facilitate faster loading times for returning customers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These are a few ways that will help your website load quicker and deliver the best results. There are other ways to drastically improve your website depending on the requirements of the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, this calls for expertise, and availing the services of a professional <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.b3net.com/fundamentals-of-digital-marketing\">digital marketing</a> company</strong> can prove a sensible entrepreneurial decision.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 3: No Call-To-Action</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One of the potential reasons your website is failing to generate leads is that it may lack clear, compelling calls to action for the visitors.

Is it simple enough to scroll through and get all the information in as few clicks as possible? Are there any unnecessary clicks and therefore, unnecessary page navigation involved for any particular section?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing irritates a visitor quite as much as a website’s confusing navigation. If they struggle to find the information they are looking for within your website, chances are they will abandon your site never to return.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it? <strong>Streamlined &amp; Simplified Navigation</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, there is a simple fix to this problem. It&#8217;s more of a design issue than anything else. You just need to streamline your content’s layout and simplify the navigation with as few layers of clicks as possible. But simple ain’t easy. Here are the steps involved:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Make it more intuitive and smooth flowing</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Use clear &amp; descriptive labels for the menu and organize content logically.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Limit the number of items in the main menu and segregate wisely</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Use modern designs and drop-downs to expand the navigation panel</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Integrate a search bar on every page for quick search</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When navigation feels smooth, your visitors stay longer, convert into customers, and your organic traffic increases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 5: Not Mobile Friendly</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile devices will surely be the most prominent player in the way people access the internet.

Expert designers at our <strong>digital marketing company</strong> suggest implementing the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Adopt a mobile-first approach, where the website is designed to look and work its best on a mobile device.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Optimize fonts, layouts, buttons, and content structures for mobile viewing.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Test your website across multiple mobile devices to ensure seamless integration and responsiveness.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 6: Unstructured Lead Generation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Lead generation is a systematic process and it involves an intricate design in its structure. Implementing haphazard action steps without any deliberate planning in place will lead to chaotic results and lost opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, cluttered and confusing landing pages with contact forms asking for unnecessary information can deter potential leads.Users may take it personally if your forms tend to ask for unnecessary information. They feel insecure and uncomfortable to part with personal information. It may backfire and turn them away.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7790\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-6.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-6-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-6-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it? <strong>Optimize Each Step of The Lead Generation Process</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping it simple has immense value. It appeals to the masses and attracts the kind of audiences that are willing to stick around. Give your lead generation process a clear structure with clearly defined steps involved in it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Define the lead generation process of your organization and website.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Describe the steps involved and create a structured flow for visitors to follow.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Design clean and visually appealing landing pages with a clear purpose and a strong value proposition.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Remove unnecessary distractions and focus on highlighting the benefits of your offering.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Use the lead capture forms strategically without overwhelming the visitors with too many questions.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Optimize contact forms by keeping them short.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Assure users that their information will be secure.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Incentivize the visitors to share information by offering lead magnets such as freebies, ebooks, exclusive content, discounts, free trials, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Building trust and credibility requires dedicated hard work. But it is well worth the effort when your website starts pouring in with loads of leads for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 7: Too Much Focus on Bottom-Of-The-Funnel Users</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7791\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-7.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-7-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-7-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the sales funnel in and out is one of the key factors that drive success in any business. There is a reason why the sales funnel has three stages. They build off of one another and are closely interlinked to each other.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, 9 out of 10 queries made by the Top-of-the Funnel users (TOFU) &amp; Middle-of-the-Funnel Users (MOFU) have a lead generation potential.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most companies that fail at lead generation are focusing too much on the BOFU. They are neglecting the leads at other stages of the sales funnel and therefore, they lose on a large chunk of potential leads.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, since the (Bottom-Of-The-Funnel Users) BOFU customers are the ones that eventually pay up, companies are erroneously focusing on only them. It’s akin to focusing on the fruit rather than watering the plant.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately 90% of the customer base comprise the top and middle level users, i.e., TOFU &amp; MOFU, in the sales funnel. By only focusing on BOFU, companies are missing out on a large chunk of potential customers and leads that could lead to conversion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it? <strong>Target Leads at Every Stage of The Funnel</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You never know at what stage a visitor may catapult and transition into a customer. You better hope for the best and start grinding at every opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Create content addressing the pain points, needs, and expectations of visitors at every stage of the sales funnel.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Offer educational and informational content for <strong>top-of-the-funnel</strong> users <strong>(TOFU)</strong>. Examples, blog posts, ebooks, how-to guides, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Provide case studies, product demos, and customer testimonials for leads in the consideration stage or <strong>middle-of-the-funnel</strong> users <strong>(MOFU)</strong>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Offer free trials, consultations, or discounts to the leads who are in the decision-making stage i.e., the <strong>bottom-of-the-funnel</strong> users <strong>(BOFU)</strong>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Tailor your CTAs accordingly and align the messages with each stage of the funnel to drive conversions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Grab the opportunities to serve well no matter where you stand in the queue, and you are bound to be rewarded well in return.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 8: Poor, Insufficient, or Misaligned Content</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7792\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-8.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-8-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-8-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Content is the foundation of successful lead generation.

Googlebots, also known as crawlers, spiders, or simply bots, are programs meant to visit various websites and report back to Google what they found during their visits.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7812\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-2-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, there are a few reasons these bots aren&#8217;t able to crawl through your web pages. Maybe you are blocking them &#8211; intentionally or unintentionally.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Technical misconfiguration</strong> &#8211; <strong>Fixing the robots.txt</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Within your website, Google asks you to set up a route map or directive to follow for the Googlebots. These are known as robots.txt, and they guide the search engine crawlers while navigating your site&#8217;s pages. If your robots.txt file contains instructions restricting the bots to crawl and index a few of your web pages, Google will not know about those pages.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It&#8217;s an error known as a crawl error. There could be various reasons for this &#8211; such as erroneously ticking particular options that lead to putting up a command or instruction for Google not to visit certain pages.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, most developers keep the &#8220;noindex&#8221; tag activated during the development phase and might forget to remove it at the time of going live.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever the causes of the issues, let&#8217;s see the possible solutions to fix them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it?</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To fix this, review your robots.txt file. Ensure that your site&#8217;s robot.txt file has clear instructions that allow access to the relevant sections of your website to let Googlebots crawl through your site&#8217;s pages smoothly.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/https-www-b3net-com-robots-txt.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7852 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/https-www-b3net-com-robots-txt.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"761\" height=\"317\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/https-www-b3net-com-robots-txt.png 761w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/https-www-b3net-com-robots-txt-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\r\n<li><strong>Crawl errors &#8211; Broken links, duplicate content, etc.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If your website contains broken links, it will not let Googlebots explore it properly. Also, if your website has duplicate content, it will confuse Googlebots. In both cases, it will lead to a crawl error.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it?</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Regularly monitor Google Search Console for any crawl errors and fix them promptly to facilitate proper indexing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Look for broken links within your website and fix them as soon as you find them.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>First, try to make your content as unique as possible. And, if you have to include some duplicate parts of your content, ensure that you use canonical tags to let Google know which version of the content you would want to be preferred as original.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Additionally, interlink the important pages of the site to facilitate effective and smooth navigation for the crawlers to discover your website in its entirety.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 3: Google Penalized Your Website</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Google penalties are a dreadful thing. It eventually leads to delisting a site from the search results, which means the site&#8217;s rankings for its target keywords drop dramatically. As a result, if Google penalizes your website, your target audience won&#8217;t be able to find you. And it may penalize any website that violates its guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-3-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7815\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-3-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-3-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-3-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-3-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, to keep and maintain the high quality and integrity of the search results, Google has laid down specific guidelines known as <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials\">Google Search Essentials</a>. It states the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts a website should follow to feature high in the search results.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In short, Google is against manipulative and spammy practices. And if your website is caught on the radar, whether it&#8217;s the culprit or not, Google will penalize it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of penalties &#8211; algorithmic and manual. Whatever the type of penalty, the following are the common reasons a website gets penalized by Google:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>keyword stuffing or irrelevant keywords</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>hidden text or links,</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>cloaking (displaying different content to search engines and users),</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>low-quality or duplicate content,</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>unnatural or spammy backlinks attracting spyware, adware, and viruses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is worth noting here that penalties can also occur due to unintentional mistakes or through the actions of a malicious competitor.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to fix it?</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fixing it has two operations. Finding what went wrong and then making the appropriate corrections to bring it back on track. Follow the below steps to get out of the penalty zone.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Conduct a thorough audit and analysis of your website and review its &#8211;\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Content,</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Backlinks,</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Technical elements</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Remove or rewrite any content that violates Google&#8217;s guidelines</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Remove toxic and malicious backlinks</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Address the technical issues that may have led to your website&#8217;s penalty.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once the necessary changes are made, submit a reconsideration request to Google for a chance to regain your website&#8217;s visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Recovering from a penalty can take time. So have patience and continue adhering to Google&#8217;s guidelines. It is essential to maintain high-quality, valuable content, engage in ethical SEO practices, and monitor your website regularly so that you do not have to ever again worry about why your web<strong>site is not showing up on Google.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reason 4: Your Website Is Too Slow</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-4-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-7816\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-4-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-4-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/B3NET-Blog-Banner-4-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People do not want to wait for long for a website to load.

This allowed the Search engines to find the product data and instead of taking the customers to the list of the products page, it could directly suggest the particular product page the users were looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Result:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>There was an increase of <strong>66%</strong> in website sessions</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The online orders increased by <strong>187%</strong></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The sales increased by <strong>190%</strong></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The <strong>Return On Investment</strong> (ROI) was close to <strong>4 times</strong>. That indicates for every dime spent, 4 were earned back.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Negative Mobile Experience &#8211; Mobile Optimization</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There is a reason why companies with the biggest conversion rates have transitioned their website on the lines of the mobile-first design approach. With more than 50% of the web traffic coming from mobile devices, the mobile-friendliness of a website has to be given top priority.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7892 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-3.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-3-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-3-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So here’s a fact check for you. Is your website mobile responsive? If you answered no, you have found one of the major factors why your <strong>website is not converting</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to user experience, if your website opens with a standard desktop view on a mobile device, it surely will reflect a high bounce rate. And, you need to fix it as soon as possible, because you do not want to lose more than half of your potential users just because of not offering them a website in their preferred version on the device of their choice.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Multiple Choices Leave Customers Confused &#8211; No Clear Focus On A Single CTA</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7893 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/4-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>CTAs or Call-to-Actions are triggers for your users to take action. It has to be strategically placed, made captivating and attractive, and direct the customer to take a desired action.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>These CTAs could either convert to sales-generating leads or simply register a sale for your website. Examples are: Subscribe now, Download free, Learn more, Create my account, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, offering too many options for the customers inside one CTA, such as ‘Subscribe Now &amp; Create an Account’, etc. Or, offering more than one CTA for the customers on the same web page can lead to confusion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is often known as analysis paralysis or decision paralysis where customers are perplexed by the multiple choices they have in front of them leading to indecision and thus, lost opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By providing a clear and singular call to action, you eliminate decision paralysis and guide visitors toward a specific action, increasing the likelihood of conversion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Case Studies:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the leading <strong>digital marketing agency</strong> experts agree that tweaking the CTA is perhaps the easiest and quickest way to garner some results. There are a lot of interesting case studies where a tweak in CTAs leads to a dramatic change in website’s conversion rate. Let&#8217;s see some of them below.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Making the CTA button larger, denser, and darker, helped Demio, a webinar management company, to increase its conversion rate by around 58 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kommunicate.io/\">Kommunicate</a> is an AI chatbot builder. And it witnessed an increase in the Click Through Rate (CTR) when they replaced the email field with the text “Try for free”. You can even notice that the first CTA button is placed at a strategic location, viz., top right corner.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The subsequent CTAs are placed as the content progresses further down, but they have a lot of space around to be noticeable.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Your Website is Forever in the &#8216;Buffering&#8217; Status</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7896 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/5-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>3&#8230;2…1… and off they go!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It&#8217;s quicker than the time an average person takes a breath. One of the major factors why your <strong>website is not converting</strong> is that it might be pretty slow in loading. Slow-loading websites can be a major turn-off for visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this fast-paced and highly mobile and portable age, your website should load quickly. If it doesn’t, visitors are likely to abandon it and seek alternatives. And, you don’t want that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>High Bounce Rate</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A high bounce rate indicates that visitors are leaving your website without exploring further. When a website takes too long to load, it not only leads to high bounce rates but also contributes to a negative user experience, resulting in missed conversion opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The reasons could be many. Faulty web design, heavy file sizes increasing load times, bad layout and navigation, or bad traffic source where traffic is coming from an erroneous source, for example, a doctor&#8217;s website being visited by traffic from a car brand due to adverts placed on them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Optimizing your website performance, including compressing images, and using cache techniques to increase browsing memory can reduce load times and increase visitor engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Case Study: </strong><a href=\"https://www.logicinbound.com/ecommerce-case-study-increased-organic-searches-by-248-decrease-bounce-rates-by-93/\"><strong>Shoppe’s Shoppe</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A gift shop boutique Shoppe’s Shoppe offers beautifully designed gift boxes and gift shop items like home decor, accent pieces, candles, etc., from their eCommerce website.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It was doing well locally but wanted to leverage more on the digital presence to increase its customer base. However, their main area of concern was an unengaging website, and high bounce rates, and they did not have any SEO knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a result, their website content and copy were lackluster, uninformative, without targeting any keywords, and lacking SEO optimization. Neither their posts nor product listings were SEO optimized, so Sophie’s Shoppe did not rank in any Google search results.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Remedy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After a thorough audit and analysis of the website, it was revamped and redesigned and all the out-of-stock products were removed. This made the new website fully functional, and updated with the current stock products listings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The content was made more engaging and SEO optimized with relevant targeted keywords placed prominently and strategically. Products listings were relisted as per keyword research and after conducting a thorough competitor analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Result</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>248% increase in organic search traffic</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>New users increased by 236%</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>93% reduction in bounce rate on the website</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Significant increase in engagement, customer base, and revenue</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. High Added Costs At Checkout &amp; Complicated Checkout Procedure (Leading to High Cart-abandonment Rate)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Experts at leading <strong>digital marketing agencies</strong> say that it might very well be due to various factors and a lot of them are static and not going to change. But, the ones that are variable and can be changed should be changed.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7897 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Out of the total number of users who abandon the cart, 48% of users abandon it due to unexpected extra costs at checkout, like shipping, tax, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The checkout process is a critical phase where potential customers can be lost if they encounter unexpected costs or a complicated procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>No Option for Guest Check Out</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Forcing visitors to create an account before making a purchase can be a significant deterrent. Consider the fact that 24% of users abandon because the site wanted them to create an account.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A simplified checkout procedure enhances the user experience and encourages conversions. Offering a guest checkout option simplifies the process and increases the chances of completing a purchase.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Your Landing Page Has Too Many Pop Ups</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to the best web designers, pop-ups are simply bad designs on display. They hinder the user experience and might also irritate the user if a website’s landing page has too many pop-ups. The most common pop-ups are for cookie acceptance, followed by pop-ups for email subscriptions and free ebook downloads.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7898 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/7-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While these may be great lead generators, they should be used moderately and wisely. Despite being an irritating element of web designs, it still rakes in a lot of conversions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>According to Wisepops exit intent popups, i.e., popups just at the moment of exiting the website, can save up to 20% of cart abandonment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, landing page pop-ups usually lead to a negative conversion, since the moment a customer lands on your website, it is greeted by a pop-up that they might not be expecting.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While pop-ups can be effective for promotions and lead capture, excessive use can frustrate visitors and hinder conversions. Striking a balance by using pop-ups sparingly and ensuring they provide genuine value to the visitor&#8217;s journey is the key to a successful conversion.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Your Products Are Great, But Not Your Website Pages &#8211; Bad UX</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7899 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Having outstanding products or services is one thing, and even if your products and services are exceptional, a poorly designed and confusing website can restrict conversions.

More Focus On Guesswork Than Data-driven Insights</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One of the reasons your <strong>website traffic is not converting</strong> is that you may be relying on gut feelings, guesswork, and assumptions rather than real-time data-driven insights.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Guesswork and assumptions about the market could be a risky game. It could hinder your website’s ability to optimize and capitalize on the opportunities leading to real-time conversions.

It means only one thing. Your website does not match your customer sentiments, needs, wants, and expectations. The reasons for this could be many.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>From technical issues to plain dull and non-compelling offers, you may be putting the effort, time, and energy in the wrong direction.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It&#8217;s time you do some corrections and set sail on the right course.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Is Your Website Responsive?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8211\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even though half of the global website traffic comes from mobile devices, 96% of them encountered problems while browsing websites from their phones. As a result, 48% of users left feeling frustrated.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The reason this data is crucial is that we have a fundamental issue staring right at us if your website is not designed with the mobile in mind. Your visitors may come, and there the analytics will show that your website is getting traffic. But to get a clearer picture, you need to dig in deep. Look at the bounce numbers, how long are people staying on your website, and what causes them to abandon your site?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As most marketers will agree that it is as big an opportunity as it is a problem, let’s look at how to fix it and turn this problem into an opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When the world moved to access the internet on the go, designers have wracked their minds to meet visitors on their mobile devices through mobile responsive websites. They call it the mobile-first design approach.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This design approach builds your site keeping in mind mobile devices first and foremost. It is then coupled with giving similar, easy, and uniform access across devices and screens to provide your users with a seamless browsing experience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our experienced designers at<a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/orange-county-web-design.html\"><strong> Web Design Company in Dallas</strong></a> suggest that if your website isn’t responsive to various screens and devices, it’s time you fix this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Does Your Website Get Enough Traffic?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8212\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-2.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-2-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-2-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the average number of conversions will tell us that out of 100 visitors, only 2.35% will amount to conversion. This number may differ from industry to industry.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some of them, for example, e-commerce sites, hover as low as a 1% conversion ratio. Some stats also tell quite another story. Some e-commerce sites and pages are raking in a consistent 10% conversions. But, what does that tell you? You may be thinking that <a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/9-reasons-why-my-website-traffic-not-converting\"><strong>my website doesn’t convert</strong></a>, but It&#8217;s simple. Your website is garnering a lot of traffic, but it&#8217;s simply not enough to make your sales numbers go up.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are generating a 1% conversion rate, you need to have an average of 100 visitors to make that single conversion. If you are targeting 100 conversions, then your traffic must shoot up to 10000 visitors. The math is simple, and so is the fix.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Ramp up your website’s visitor count. Ironically, simple and easy ain’t synonyms and the fix is not as easy as it may sound simple.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It requires a whole range of <a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/fundamentals-of-digital-marketing\">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) efforts starting from optimization of your website through the use of specific target-oriented keywords, drafting engaging, high-quality, and captivating content to serve the users’ search intent, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Truth be told, it’s a whole maze of SEO-inclined technical steps involved, from getting a clean SEO-targeted URL structure to optimizing header tags, images, and anchor texts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then, there involves interlinking and backlinking to your website for a structured navigation pattern and credibility. It will give Google and its search crawlers enough signals to rank your website high enough for the right set of keywords and search queries.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Is Your Website Using All The Sources To Attract Traffic?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8213\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-3.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-3-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-3-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If your website is not generating enough traffic in the first place, the conversion chances drop drastically as a natural result. Ideally, organic traffic brings the best and the major chunk of traffic for any website. But, if it is not, then you need to look for other sources of traffic for your website.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, you may be working and fixing how to bring more visitors to your website organically. However, generating organic traffic through SEO efforts is a long-term game. It does give a long-term result, but it takes patience and a bit of technical expertise too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, you can do other things in the meanwhile while your website gets an SEO overhaul.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are a lot of traffic sources apart from organic traffic, such as paid traffic, referral traffic, direct traffic, campaign traffic, email traffic, etc. You may start a marketing campaign, or start building an email list that will deliver your marketing messages for your customers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our experienced digital marketers at B3NET Inc., a leading <a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/dallas-digital-marketing-agency.html\"><strong>digital marketing company in Dallas</strong></a>, points out that one important source of traffic is paid advertising. It can shoot your website traffic pretty quickly if done in the right way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, you need to have a systematic approach to doing paid advertising to bring the right kind of traffic to your website. Your advertising should be targeted toward the right kind of people, locations, and demographics.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They should also reveal just enough to inform and be compelling enough to make the audience click through your advertising. If done correctly, it rightly justifies the return on investment (ROI).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, use social media as a big promoter of your website. This is perhaps one of the quicker ways to get your website at the forefront of your ideal audience. However, before choosing social media, you need to do your research as to which platform is best suitable for your line of business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>Does Your Website Attract The Right Kind Of Traffic?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8214\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-4.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-4-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-4-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One of the core but often undermined reasons your <strong>website is not generating sales</strong> is it might be pulling in the wrong traffic for you. It&#8217;s simply not enough to generate traffic, you need also to look at what kind of visitors your website is attracting. Is it attracting the right people?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who is readily searching for the products or services you are offering is the right and ideal kind of audience for your website. When such visitors come to your website, it is attracting the right kind of traffic. And, when such visitors flock in high numbers, your chances of converting them into leads and customers rise.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, what if you are attracting visitors who are looking for something else? They might have accidentally landed on your website, only to find out that it is not what they were looking for. In such a case, your website’s visitor count will rise, but it will also cause the number of Average Engaging Sessions to go down. Look for such numbers in Google Analytics that tell your visitors are simply landing on your website only to abandon them after a few seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The average visitors&#8217; session, if less than 30 seconds, indicates many things on various levels. For one, it may indicate your web page may not be loading fast enough. Secondly, the visitors may find it difficult to browse through your web page and most likely they went to your competitor’s site after that.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, it also indicates that the user may have unintendedly landed on your site. For instance, how useful a website can be for a user looking to purchase shaving blades when your business deals in selling car brakes?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The fix to this problem lies in two parts. First, you need to have a close look at your website traffic dynamics. As explained above, checking the number of Average Engaging Sessions and determining where the traffic is coming from can lead you to ascertain whether your visitors have any interest in your products or services. Now comes the other part. You need to rethink your keyword strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An effective keyword strategy involves finding out what your ideal customers are searching for and using what kind of phrases, words, or sentences. Sometimes, keyword trends change over time due to various factors. And, your keywords should reflect the current ways of users’ search queries. Have a good mix of keywords &#8211; trending ones, the ones with lesser competition, long-tail keywords, and also the ones reflecting natural language search.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once this is done, you need to ideally restructure the website’s content, navigation, and SEO in line with the new keywords. This brings us to the next checklist, which is all about your website’s content strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. <strong>What Is Your Website’s Content Strategy?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8215\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-5.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-5-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-5-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When your website’s content strategy is not in place, the content will not resonate with your brand’s voice. It can lead to inconsistent brand messaging. As a result, everything you do with your website will amount to being a wasted resource.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The effect of this is low conversion rates and user engagement. If your users are not spending time on your website, you will not know enough about their behaviors, preferences, and needs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You may wonder why your <strong>website is not making sales</strong> when it can generate traffic. It is a classic case of missed opportunities and inefficient resource allocation, making you lose the competitive edge.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thankfully, there is a sensible approach to realign your website’s content strategy. It involves:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Defining the goal of your business, website, and its content, and knowing your audience’s demographics, pain points, expectations, etc. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You may also conduct a competitor analysis and find out more about your competitors&#8217; content. What are they posting and where? This will give you an idea of what to repeat and what not to do. You will also find out how your competitors are positioning themselves through their content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next step involves creating a content plan, resonating with your brand’s voice, and addressing your customers&#8217; various issues. It is best to address one issue at a time, so you might require several different contents to address all the issues.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Create a content schedule or calendar where you will know exactly what content goes at what time and on which platform. And, then begin creating high-quality original content with three goals in mind &#8211; educating your audience, informing them about your product, and engaging with them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. <strong>Is Your Website Free From Technical Issues?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8216\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-6.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-6-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-6-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The downtimes can eat up your business revenues. Consider the fact that the average downtime cost per minute for small businesses can be $427 per minute, and when it comes to large enterprises the amount shoots up to $9000 per minute.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Right from security vulnerabilities to broken links and checkout process errors, there could be a lot of areas to cover if your website has any technical glitches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A thorough technical review of your website will reveal the exact areas where your website is lagging. The SEO experts at our <strong>Digital Marketing Company in Dallas</strong> remind us that the most important page to audit for technical issues is the checkout page. If it is not working properly, you will know why is your <strong>website not making sales.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Check if the payment gateways have been integrated properly. Also, for a quick checkout process, you may offer a guest checkout option.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Other than that, if your landing page has a pop-up integrated, check that it closes properly and the main page is displayed upon closing the pop-up. Too many pop-ups on a website also make it slow. It also annoys your visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, keep on monitoring your website for technical issues. It may pop up at any time leading you to wonder why is <strong>your website not generating sales</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. <strong>Do You Have An Appealing Conversion Goal?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-7-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8217\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-7-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-7-1.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-7-1-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-7-1-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The problem that your <strong>website is not making sales</strong>, lies at several levels.

Let them feel and know that there is no harm in giving it a try. It all depends on how you position your business and how your website content leads the customer to take desirable actions. Do not aim for stars right away.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can start with a goal of gathering 5% leads through various channels such as email sign-ups, pop-ups, visitor forms, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you are using more than one lead generator, get them spaced out throughout your website with proper navigation. Too many lead generators cluttered in one space could be confusing, congested, and also irritating to visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you manage to get leads, you will also manage to convert them into customers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. <strong>Is Your Offer Interesting Enough For Buyers To Spend Their Money?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8218\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-8.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-8-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-8-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If your website is generating traffic, maybe your offers aren’t compelling enough to convert them into sales.

Consider alluring your customers with extra discounts, exclusive offers for returning customers, free shipping, or a free return policy for physical products.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most often your customers will not only try out the products but also visit for a repeat purchase if you have the right offer for your customers. Look for what your competitors offer, and try to either match them, better them or offer something unique or additional that they are not offering.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. <strong>Do You Have A Back-up Plan To Improve Conversions When Nothing Is Working?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\r\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-9.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-8219\" src=\"https://www.b3net.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-9.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-9.jpg 900w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-9-300x100.jpg 300w, https://2026.b3net.info/b3net-com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/B3NET-Article-Banner-9-768x256.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" /></a></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When your conversions are not improving and your <strong>website is not generating sales</strong>, despite your efforts, you need to think out of the box. And, having a backup plan beforehand helps invariably in most cases.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the risk of wasting valuable time and resources, missed opportunities, and eroding market share, not having a backup plan means failing to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>The Fix:</em></strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Envisage your customer journey beforehand and think of the worst-case scenarios to come out with the best possible solution. Give way to the exit intent pop-ups, retarget your customers through social proofs and testimonials, and give them a date and time to shower urgency to act.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you could also personalize the experience for them since <a href=\"https://www.epsilon.com/us/about-us/pressroom/new-epsilon-research-indicates-80-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-make-a-purchase-when-brands-offer-personalized-experiences\">80%</a> of your customers are likely to purchase when you offer personalized experiences for them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>It’s Time for Your Website’s Sales Transformation</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the competitive online landscape, your website is rightfully the digital showcase for your business.
